Each folder contains 1 year of output files after spinning up the respective model for 3 years. The logfiles detail the namelist values used. These files can be used for comparison to make sure the model is running properly on your machine.

All simulations were performed on EULER (ETH Zurich) by Robb Wills with the version of the code published 3 July 2014.
