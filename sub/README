fms submission shell script - for LSF jobs
written by Tobias Bischoff, September 2014

Instructions:
1. Create a experiment directory (exp/'exp_name'/) with a run_exp file in exp/'exp_name'/run/.
The run_exp file should have run_name = RUN_NAME.
All experiments will use namelist values from run_exp unless they are modified in list_exp.

2. Make a list of experiments to run in list_exp. For example, to do a sweep over odp, the parameter
multiplying the longwave optical depth, the list would look like:

default_idealized odp 1.0
default_idealized odp 2.0
default_idealized odp 3.0
default_idealized odp 4.0 

As many namelist parameters as needed can be specified in this way, but all will show up in the run 
name, creating long filenames.

(e.g., an experiment listed as 'default_idealized odp 1.0 del_sol = 1.6' will have the run name
default_idealized_odp_1.0_del_sol_1.6)

3. Submit all jobs at once by going to the fms_default/sub/ folder and typing 'sh run_exp.sh'

4. A file list_exp_submitted will automatically be created which lists the experiments with the time 
of submission.
