=== Description of script default_moist/run/run_test ===

This is the default run script for the idealized_moist GCM. See description
of the model version at ~/fms/README.

This script assumes the following hierarchical structure for FMS
model simulations:
The variable ${exp_name} refers to the experiment. Experiments are
builds of the model, which typically each have different source code.
The variable ${run_name} refers to the individual run of a given
experiment. Runs typically each have different parameters.
The directory ~/fms contains only model input.
Run scripts are named ~/fms/exp/${exp_name}/run/run_${run_name}.
Initial unprocessed output is put in ~/fms_tmp/${exp_name}/${run_name}.
Final analyzed data output is put in
${home}/fms_output/${exp_name}/${run_name}/.

The length of each model run is ${days}. Long runs can be created by
doing a series of consecutive iterations, each of length
${days}. There are two counters in the script, $irun and $ireload. The
former is used to do multiple iterations of the model in a single
submission of the run script. The latter is used to do multiple
iterations by resubmitting the run script. Either method should be
equivalent.

Each iteration of the model run script is followed by a submission of
the analysis code (called by the model run script), which makes
a temporal (and optionally zonal) mean of the results. The version of
the analysis code is specified in the $analysis_version variable. By
default the analysis code does a temporal mean of the entire iteration
of the run. It is also possible to do time-mean analyses of individual
time segments of the run (typically to consider a seasonal cycle) by
varying ${days_per_segment}.

To facilitate comparison between different versions of the model, all
changes to gcm source code should be done in the srcmods/ directory
only.

=== Update of March 2012 === 
       
- Dry and moist models are running from the same source. model_type has 
  to be set as "dry" or "moist". The parameters for the physical 
  parametrizations are defined in the namelists from line 210.  
  ~/fms/exp/${exp_name}/input contains other namelists in namelists_dry 
  and namelists_moist corresponding respectively to the dry and to the moist 
  model. 
- Possibility to choose between 2d (zonally averaged) or 3d (zonally varying)  
  outputs  (variable ${analysis_type})       
- Implementation of the RAW filter (Zhihong Tan) to improve the RA filter. 
  The robert parameter has not been changed. The RAW filter introduces an 
  additional positive filter parameter smaller than 1 (a value of 1 
  corresponds to the RA filter). It has been set at 0.53 and can be
  modified in spectral_dynamics.nml declared in the namelist files
  in ~/fms/exp/${exp_name}/input. The RAW filter is described and tested in
  "Williams, P. D., 2011: Mon. Wea. Rev., 137, 1996-2007" and tested
  in a GCM similar to ours in "Amezuca J. et al. Mon. Wea. Rev., 139, 
  608-619"
- New variable names in the 2d analysis (Xavier Levine). See the 
  wiki page of the group for more details:

=== Update of August/September 2012 === 

- Possibility of using a bucket model for the hydrology. $model_type has
  to be set at "moist_hydro" in the run_test
- Two-stream radiation scheme allows annual cycle and orbital cycles
- Implementation of the exponential filter (Sep 26 2012: still has
  to be checked).
- Updates in the analysis (spectral budget of EKE and APE, surface drag,
  bucket variable for the "moist_hydro" version of the GCM)

=== Update of August 2013 ===

- Runscripts and mkmk files are included customized for 2 local systems,
Brutus at ETH Zurich, and Fram at Caltech
- The queueing system is LSF on Brutus versus PBS on Fram.
- Affected files are in fms_default/analysis/analysis_*/run, 
fms_default/exp/*/run, and fms_default/idealized/bin/. Comparing between
files labeled as Brutus (or left blank) and files labelled as Fram should 
give an idea which lines need to be changed when importing to a different 
local system

=== Update of June 2014 ===

- ${machine} flag added for BSUB machines such that a mkmf template can be
referenced and the intel, openmpi, and netcdf modules loaded can be customized 
for the machine being used. Currently this is set up for Brutus and Euler at ETH
Zurich
- Modified to work on specified ${tmpdir1} instead of home directory. This work
directory should be set to local scratch space where there is space to keep files 
up to 10s of TB temporarily. The necessary output and restart files are copied 
to the home directory after the analysis completes.
- gaussian_topog_nml is placed in runscript to make it easier to enable topography
- added ${ocean_mask} which can reference an ocean_mask nc-file if load_mask = 
.true. (Ori Adam)

=== Update of September 2014 ===

- Update for Euler - no longer copies fms_tmp back to home directory since the home 
directory is backed up. Keep fms_output and fms_tmp on global scratch. It will not
be deleted without notification, but it is best to regularly back up to Napuka.
- To facilitate storage, only two restart files are kept in 
fms_tmp/*/*/output/restart
- Fixed bug due to splitting of spectral_dynamics_nml between the run script and
the namelist in input. Namelists cannot be split or the one in input will not be 
read
