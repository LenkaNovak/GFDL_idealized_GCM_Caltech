=== conv_gray_orbital_seaice ===

Moist idealized atmospheric GCM with slab ocean. Can be run in
perpetual equinox or with seasonally varying solar forcing, and in the
latter case Earth's orbital parameters can be specified. Sea ice
component (optional) is included.

Model namelists are in input/ directory:
diag_table (list of diagnostics to be computed)
spectral_pathnames (paths to source code files)
spectral_namelist ()

This is mostly X version of dynamic core. File structure (using expt
folder for namelist and runscript files, rather than having input/ and
script/ folders) is from X version of dynamic core.
